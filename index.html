<p><h2>Business Analytics:</h2></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metacritic Review Scores vs Video Game Sales Project (In progress)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/2E6xPZW">http://bit.ly/2E6xPZW</a>)</p>
<p>In this project, I analyzed to see if video game review scores on Metacritc have some kind of impact on game sales in different regions of the world. If they do, how much influence do they have? And when did this trend start? And what steps can PR/Marketing team of the publishers take to improve their game sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hyatt Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis Project</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/2DKlRas">http://bit.ly/2DKlRas</a>)</p>
<p>The main focus of this project is to suggest ideas and recommendations to see what factors influence a customer's satisfactory level with his/her stay at different levels Hyatt chain and what can Hyatt do to improve the customers&rsquo; Net Promoter Score (NPS) value, based on our analyses from the results of Hyatt's customer surveys from its hotels around the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patients No-Show Poster Project</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/2FcGWYx">http://bit.ly/2FcGWYx</a>)</p>
<p>Missing medical appointment has become a prevalent problems for the healthcare systems in many countries including the US, as missed appointments cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $150 billion a year. I want to explore what factors might contribute to the no-show problem to the medical appointments.</p>
<p><strong>Data Cleanse, Transformation and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genbank Data Disambiguation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/2nzC34l">http://bit.ly/2nzC34l</a>)</p>
<p>There are millions of authors and inventors who submit references to NCBI&rsquo;s GenBank, and there are a wide range of alternate spellings of a person&rsquo;s or institution&rsquo;s name. Typos and misspellings of names are also common in bibliographic data.</p>
<p>The goal of this disambiguation project is to link all of these alternate spellings of institutional or individual names without incorrectly linking similar names referring to distinct entities. This is a difficult task, as there are millions of names to disambiguate (making pairwise comparisons of the full dataset computationally expensive) and an evaluation of how likely two names on patents are to be the same entity is not known a priori and often relies on machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>To effectively alleviate these difficulties, I wrote and implemented an innovative co-author matching method, and managed to disambiguate 50% of the records with high confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Database Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Insurance Claim Management System SQL Project </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(<a href="http://bit.ly/2FfnEBQ">http://bit.ly/2FfnEBQ</a>)</p>
<p>I have designed a Health Insurance Claim Management System for a clinic. I Created the database structure using Microsoft&rsquo;s Access and SQL Server DBMSs as implementation vehicles. It has a simple design that focuses on the ETL of patient information and insurance billing information storage.</p>
